# Analysis Outputs Guide

This folder contains all the results generated by the Content Gap Analysis pipeline and Question Generator. Here is a plain-language guide to help you understand and interpret each file.

## 📄 Main Reports

### `gap_analysis_report.md`
**What is it?**  
The master report summarizing all findings.  
**How to use it:**  
Start here. It gives you a high-level overview of what's missing in your quiz content (gaps), what topics are over-represented, and specific recommendations. It combines insights from all the other files into a readable format.

## 📊 Data Quality

### `quality_report.csv`
**What is it?**  
A detailed spreadsheet showing quality metrics for every single question analyzed.
**How to use it:**  
Use this if you need to check specific questions. Columns usually include length checks (too short/too long) and completeness (missing answers).

### `quality_report_violations.csv`
**What is it?**  
A specific list of only the questions that **failed** quality checks (e.g., questions longer than 100 characters).
**How to use it:**  
This is your "fix-it" list. Go through these rows to clean up your existing data.

### `quality_metrics_chart.png`
**What is it?**  
A bar chart visualizing the overall health of your dataset.
**How to use it:**

## 🧠 Semantic & Topic Analysis

### `clusters_visualization.png`
**What is it?**  
A "map" of your questions. Each dot is a question. Dots close together are similar in meaning.
**How to use it:**  
- **Dense clouds:** Topics you have a lot of questions about.
- **Empty white spaces:** Topics you are missing (Content Gaps).
- Look for isolated islands or sparse areas to find new topic opportunities.

### `ngram_patterns.csv`
**What is it?**  
A list of common 2-word (bigrams) and 3-word (trigrams) phrases found in your questions.
**How to use it:**  
Identify repetitive phrasing. If "What is the" appears 5000 times, you might want to vary your question structures.

## 🏷️ Category & Entity Coverage

### `taxonomy_coverage.csv`
**What is it?**  
A breakdown of how well your questions cover different "sociological" life domains (e.g., Domestic Life, Digital Culture, Nostalgia).

A chart version of the taxonomy coverage data.
**How to use it:**  
Great for presentations. Visually identifying which categories are dominating and which are neglected.
